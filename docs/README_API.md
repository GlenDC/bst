Bespoken Tools Reference API
============================
# Overview
We currently only expose two classes:
- [BSTAlexa](/api/classes/bstalexa.html)
- [LambdaServer](/api/classes/lambdaserver.html)

We make them available to facilitate testing of Skills using our emulator.

BSTAlexa is our Alexa simulator. [Learn more here](/api/classes/bstalexa.html).  

The [LambdaServer](/api/classes/lambdaserver.html) makes it easy to run your Lambdas locally for unit and functional tests.

We will be adding more classes as we go forward.
